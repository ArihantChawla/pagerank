Pagerank computation by power iteration method
========

### Task:

Given a webgraph (such as one [here](https://github.com/vineethshankar/pagerank/blob/master/togit/submission/data0.dat) or [here](https://github.com/vineethshankar/pagerank/blob/master/togit/submission/data1.dat)), compute the pagerank of each webpage.

### Basics:

A webpage can be considered important and thus of a higher rank if many other pages point(link) towards it. Therefore, it is useful to think of a network as a directed graph with the webpages being its nodes and the links being its edges. See this [page](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture3/lecture3.html)from Cornell for more information and understanding.

Now, matrices can be powerful representations of graphs, allowing for further investigation. Central to the computation of pagerank is the development of a *weighted adjacency matrix*.

From a useful [link](http://www.utdallas.edu/~jwz120030/Teaching/PastCoursesUMBC/M221HS06/ProjectFiles/Adjacency.pdf) from UT Dallas,
>The adjacency matrix for a graph with n vertices is an n√ón matrix whose (i,j) entry is 1,if the ith vertex and jth vertex are connected, and 0 if they are not.
