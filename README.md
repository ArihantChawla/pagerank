Pagerank computation by power iteration method
========

### Task:

Given a webgraph (such as one [here](https://github.com/vineethshankar/pagerank/blob/master/togit/submission/data0.dat) or [here](https://github.com/vineethshankar/pagerank/blob/master/togit/submission/data1.dat)), compute the pagerank of each webpage.

### Basics:

A webpage can be considered important and thus of a higher rank if many other pages point(link) towards it. Therefore, it is useful to think of a network as a directed graph with the webpages being its nodes and the links being its edges. See this [page from Cornell](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/Lecture3/lecture3.html) for information and understanding.
